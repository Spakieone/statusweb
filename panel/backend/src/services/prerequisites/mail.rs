//! The mail vertical — "will anyone accept mail from this domain?"
//!
//! # What was already here, and why it wasn't enough
//!
//! Mail did not lack a DNS check. `GET /api/mail/domains/{id}/dns-check` has
//! existed for a long time, is wired to a "Check DNS" button, and reports
//! `4/4 records verified`. The problem is what it verifies: **existence, not
//! correctness.**
//!
//! * MX passed if the domain had *any* MX record — including one pointing at
//!   Google Workspace, i.e. precisely the configuration under which this server's
//!   mail goes nowhere.
//! * SPF passed if any `v=spf1` string existed, without checking that it
//!   authorises *this* server. A domain whose SPF ends `include:sendgrid.net -all`
//!   reported a pass while explicitly forbidding us to send.
//! * DKIM passed on `contains("v=DKIM1") || contains("p=")` — never compared to
//!   our own key, so a stale selector from a previous install passed.
//! * The A record for the mail host was not checked at all.
//! * A failure produced the string `"Not found"` and nothing to do about it.
//!
//! So an operator could see "All DNS records verified" on a domain whose mail was
//! being rejected. That is worse than no check: it is a check that certifies the
//! broken state.
//!
//! # And the records we told them to create were wrong
//!
//! There were two independent spellings of "the records this domain needs":
//! `routes::mail::domain_dns` (what we tell you to create) and
//! `routes::mail::auto_create_mail_dns` (what we create for you). They disagreed
//! on the server address, the A record's name, the MX target, the SPF policy
//! (`~all` vs `-all`) and the DKIM selector — and the manual one was outright
//! wrong, because it read the agent's **hostname** where it wanted an IP:
//!
//! ```text
//! A    mail.example.com  →  my-server            (not an address)
//! TXT  example.com       →  v=spf1 a mx ip4:my-server ~all   (invalid SPF)
//! ```
//!
//! [`mail_records`] is now the single source all three paths call. Same class as
//! the `parse_agent_cert_expiry` consolidation in v2.28.0: a value spelled in two
//! places is a value that is wrong in one of them.
